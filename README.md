FAQ
How long did it take? 
I spent 4 days to complete this game, mainly because of the limit of 3 hours and 25 requests for GPT-4. All the Pokemon game functions you can think of have been completed.

Can I get the source?
I have uploaded the code to GitHub, but because of the modularization and the need to ask ChatGPT to modify the code, I haven't organized the code properly. apologize for that.

Midjourney

What is AIGC? AIGC stands for AI Generated Content, which means content generated by artificial intelligence. Therefore, AI drawing, AI music composition, AI question answering, etc. are all examples of AIGC.

This series is about practical applications of AIGC (the blog will also have discussions on the algorithms). I believe the emergence of these tools can help us realize more ideas, and I will also use these tools to create more interesting projects to share with everyone. Don't be afraid of being replaced by AI, understanding and making good use of these tools will make you even more irreplaceable!
